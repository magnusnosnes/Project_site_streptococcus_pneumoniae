We used the number of patterns in the unitigs to define a significance threshold of the p-values of the unitigs. We detected 974212 unique patterns translating to a significance threshold of $p = 5.13\\cdot 10^{-08}$. All downstream results and visualizations were reported for unitigs with a smaller p-value than the threshold. Many of these hits were then annotated using the nomenclature of [Bakta](https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta) [@schwengers2021]. The annotations can be looked up on NCBI for further information.\n\n# Results\n\n```{r}\n#library(manhattanly)\n# Mapped \n#reference_mapping = read.table(\"/Users/magnusnygardosnes/Desktop/Postdoc/Pneumo/08_Summarize_results/ATCC700669_unitigs.plot\")\n```\n\n## Significant hits ordered by average effect size\n\n```{r }\n# <!-- Write a quick introduction to my blogpost on a GWAS analysis of Streptococcus Pneumoniae using Pyseer. \n# Include that it the conditinal gwas was doneconditionally on the covariates: country of origin, pbp allele coded after Li et. al.'s study from 2016 / 2017, and the the response variable was MIC treated as a continous variable .\n# Mention that the reader can explore the siginificant hits below and that many of the hits are annotated using the nomenclature of Bakta (which can be searched for on NCBI). --> \n\nrequire(ggplot2)\nrequire(plotly)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\ngene_hits = read.table(\"/Users/magnusnygardosnes/Desktop/Postdoc/Pneumo/08_Summarize_results/gene_hits.txt\", stringsAsFactors=FALSE, header=TRUE)\n\nAS = read.table(\"/Users/magnusnygardosnes/Desktop/Postdoc/Pneumo/07_Reference_genomes_to_map_unitigs/annotated_unitigs.txt\", sep=\"\\t\")\ngene_hits$names_for_display = gene_hits$gene\n\n#Remove name if their annotation starts with cds- to make an alnternate name list\ngene_hits$names_for_display[grep(\"cds-\", gene_hits$gene)] = \"\"\n# Ensure that the variable types are \ngene_hits$avg_maf=as.numeric(gene_hits$avg_maf)\ngene_hits$avg_beta = as.numeric(gene_hits$avg_beta)\n\n```\n\n::: {style=\"width:100%\"}\n```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=20}\n#| label: fig-effect_size_annotations\n#| fig-cap: Plot of unitigs mapped to annotated regions of references and assemblies.\n#|   This scatter plot shows the relationship between the average effect size and the maximum -log10(p-value) of genes associated with penicillin resistance.

We mapped these unitigs to different reference genomes, summarized in the table below. *Streptococcus pneumoniae* has a large pan-genome, and none of the references contain all of the unitigs. Note that a high fraction of the unitigs were found in ST556, which represents a sequence from a multidrug-resistant isolate from an otitis media patient [@li2012].\n\n| Reference strain | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| ATCC70066        | Multidrug-Resistant Pandemic Clone *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. 885 out of 2527 unitigs were mapped to this genome. <https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.01343-08>                                                                                                            |\n| Hu17             | high-level beta-lactam resistance and penicillin sensitive phenotype. 719 out of 2527 unitigs were mapped to this genome. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/data-hub/genome/GCF_002076835.1/>                                                                           |\n| EF3030           | A serotype 19F isolate that colonizes the nasopharynx of mice while being mostly noninvasive. 1359 out of 2527 unitigs were mapped to this genome. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6509521/>                                                          |\n| ST556            | A Multidrug-Resistant Isolate from an Otitis Media Patient. 2147 out of 2527 unitigs were mapped to this genome. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3370858/>                                                                                            |\n| TIGR4            | From the paper: The acquisition of clinically relevant amoxicillin resistance in *Streptococcus pneumoniae* requires ordered horizontal gene transfer of four loci. 774 out of 2527 unitigs were mapped to this genome. <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35877768/> |\n| SN75752          | From the paper: The acquisition of clinically relevant amoxicillin resistance in *Streptococcus pneumoniae* requires ordered horizontal gene transfer of four loci. 748 out of 2527 unitigs were mapped to this genome. <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35877768/> |\n\n: Information about the reference strains {#tbl-reference_strains}\n\n::: {#fig-unitigs_to_reference}\n::: {.panel-tabset style=\"width:100%\"}\n## ATCC700669\n\n```{r}\nmake_manhattan(filename = unitig_matches_in_annotation[1], annotation_name = annotated_file[1])\n```\n\n## Hu17\n\n```{r}\nmake_manhattan(filename = unitig_matches_in_annotation[2], annotation_name = annotated_file[2])\n```\n\n## EF3030\n\n```{r}\nmake_manhattan(filename = unitig_matches_in_annotation[3], annotation_name = annotated_file[3])\n```\n\n## ST556\n\n```{r}\nmake_manhattan(filename = unitig_matches_in_annotation[4], annotation_name = annotated_file[4])\n```\n\n## TIGR4\n\n```{r}\nmake_manhattan(filename = unitig_matches_in_annotation[5], annotation_name = annotated_file[5])\n```\n\n## SN75752\n\n```{r}\nmake_manhattan(filename = unitig_matches_in_annotation[6], annotation_name = annotated_file[6])\n```\n:::\n\nUnitigs mapped to various reference genomes.
