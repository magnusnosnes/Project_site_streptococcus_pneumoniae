One protein of particular interest is KhpB, which has been found to have a correlation with pbp2b, a protein is known to play a role in increasing MICS.\n\nTo understand the impact of different variants of KhpB on MIC, we created a BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) database for EloR and searched all of our isolates against it. Next we extracted the matches and the gene length of the match in the respective assemblies.\n\n## KhpB sequence length and MIC\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Blast search of assemblies against the full eloR sequence. The figure shows the relationship between the gene length and alignment length of the protein KhpB/eloR and the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the isolates in our database.

In fact, we see that most of the high MIC levels is observed around the normal gene length (approximately 986 base pairs).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## KhpB amino acid length and MIC\n\nNext we searched directly for the protein \"KhpB\" in the annotated assemblies and inspected the length of the amino acid sequence. For example, if the amino acid sequence of any was significantly shorter than the typical distribution length, it may suggest a potential correlation with increased MIC.\n\nIn 26 of the annotated assemblies, KhpB was split and the first domain of the KhpB protein was annotated as \"jag\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of Penicillin G resistance KhpB and jag annotations.

We set up a BLAST database for eloR, extracted matches and the gene length of the match in the respective assemblies, and searched for the protein \"KhpB\" in annotated assemblies to inspect the length of the amino acid sequence. Our results showed that there is no clear relationship between the gene length of KhpB and the observed penicillin MIC, and most of the high MIC levels were observed around the normal gene length. Additionally, we found that most of the high penicillin resistance levels were in the KhpB annotations, with most high MIC isolates having 328 amino acids in KhpB.\n",
