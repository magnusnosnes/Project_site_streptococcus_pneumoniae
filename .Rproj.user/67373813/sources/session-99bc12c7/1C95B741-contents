# Overview

## Models

Here we present the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted using [pyseer](https://pyseer.readthedocs.io/en/master/#) [@lees2018], a tool for identifying genetic associations with complex traits. The GWAS was performed using the linear mixed effects model such that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Penicillin G: $$\mathbf{y} \sim \mathbf{W} \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{X} \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{K} \mathbf{u} +\epsilon$$

with

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{u} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \sigma^2_g \mathbf{G} \right), \quad &\mathbf{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \sigma^2_g \mathbf{I} \right)
\end{align*}
$$

Where $\mathbf{G}$ is the similarity matrix that was obtained from the phylogenetic relationship of the samples, and $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.

: Information about the GWAS model {#tbl-model_information}

Thus we assume that the MIC can be predicted by the covariates with the correlation structure implied by the phylogenetic relationship of the samples. If we take the expectation of the equation we obtain $$E(\mathbf{y}) \sim \mathbf{W} \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{X} \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{K} \mathbf{u} +\epsilon$$ $$ = E(\mathbf{W} \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{X} \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{K} \mathbf{u} +\epsilon)$$ $$ = \mathbf{W} \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{X} \mathbf{b}$$ and variance $$V(\mathbf{y}) = V(\mathbf{W} \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{X} \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{K} \mathbf{u} +\epsilon)$$ $$
\begin{aligned}
V(\mathbf{y}) = V(\mathbf{W} \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{X} \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{K} \mathbf{u} +\epsilon) \\
= V(\mathbf{K} \mathbf{u} + \epsilon) \\
= V(\mathbf{K} \mathbf{u}) + V(\epsilon) \\
= \sigma^2_g \mathbf{G} + \sigma^2_g \mathbf{I}

## Filtering of unitigs and defining significance threshold

We filtered the unitigs based on a minimum allele frequency (MAF) between \[0.01, 0.99\] meaning that the unitigs have to be present in more than 1% and less than 99% of the isolates. We used the number of patterns in the unitigs to define a significance threshold of the p-values of the unitigs. We detected 974212 unique patterns translating to a significance threshold of $p = 5.13\cdot 10^{-08}$. All downstream results and visualizations were reported for unitigs with a smaller p-value than the threshold. Many of these hits were then annotated using the nomenclature of [Bakta](https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta) [@schwengers2021]. The annotations can be looked up on NCBI for further information.

## Unitigs mapped to reference genomes

In total we extracted 2527 significant unitigs. We mapped these unitigs to different reference genomes, summarized in the table below. *Streptococcus pneumoniae* has a large pan-genome, and none of the references contain all of the unitigs. Note that a high fraction of the unitigs were found in ST556, which represents a sequence from a multidrug-resistant isolate from an otitis media patient [@li2012].

Unitigs mapped to various reference genomes. The reference strains used for the mapping are described in the table above. The data displayed when hovering over the points in the figure represents the annotation attributes extracted from the genes that overlap with the starting position of the unitig (basepair position). It's noteworthy that the "product" and "gene" attributes can provide valuable insights into the function of the genomic regions that the unitigs overlap with.
