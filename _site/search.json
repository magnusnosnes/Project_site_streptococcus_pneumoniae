    "text": "Here we present the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted using pyseer (John A. Lees et al. 2018), a tool for identifying genetic associations with complex traits. The GWAS was performed using the linear mixed effects model such that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Penicillin G: \\[\\mathbf{y} \\sim \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{u} +\\epsilon\\]\nwith\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{u} \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left( 0, \\sigma^2_g \\mathbf{G} \\right), \\quad &\\mathbf{\\epsilon} \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left( 0, \\sigma^2_g \\mathbf{I} \\right)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) is the similarity matrix that was obtained from the phylogenetic relationship of the samples, and \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is the identity matrix.\n\n\nTable¬†1: Information about the GWAS model\n\n\nSymbol\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nùë¶\nA vector containing the MIC data for each sample.\n\n\nùëä\nA design matrix containing the conditional covariates: We used categorical variables for the variants of pencillin binding proteins pbp1a, pbp2b and pbp2x, coded according to the allele scheme proposed in (Y. Li et al. 2016), and benchmarked in (Y. Li et al. 2017). The allele codes were obtained by running the Pathogenwatch pipeline. We also included the study the data was obtained as a categorical variable, to capture differences in MIC measurement protocols.\n\n\nùëé\nFixed effects for the covariates.\n\n\nùëã\nA design matrix containing the presence or absence of the unitigs.\n\n\nùëè\nFixed effects of the unitigs.\n\n\nùêæ\nThe similarity matrix between all pairs of samples.

We used the number of patterns in the unitigs to define a significance threshold of the p-values of the unitigs. We detected 974212 unique patterns translating to a significance threshold of \\(p = 5.13\\cdot 10^{-08}\\). All downstream results and visualizations were reported for unitigs with a smaller p-value than the threshold. Many of these hits were then annotated using the nomenclature of Bakta (Schwengers et al. 2021). The annotations can be looked up on NCBI for further information."

    "section": "",
    "text": "PBPs are proteins that can attach to \\(\\beta\\)-lactam antibiotics like penicillin. These proteins are essential for making the bacterial cell wall, and when they are bound by penicillin, the antibiotic can disrupt this process. As a result, the growth and division of the bacterial cells can be impaired, making the antibiotic effective at killing or inhibiting the growth of the bacteria.\nThe PBP types shown in this document were obtained by using Pathogenwatch, which applies a PBP typing scheme developed in (Li et al. 2016) and evaluated in (Li et al. 2017). These studies demonstrated that the PBP types account for most of the variation in observed minimum inhibitory concentration \\(\\beta\\)-lactam antibiotic, and perform better than other typing schemes such as MLST.\nTo identify small and novel mechanisms that contribute to penicillin resistance, it can be helpful to control for major effects. Therefore, it is important to consider PBP composition.\nThis document gives an overview of the PBP types present in collection which will control for in further analyses. The visualization can be used to explore the PBP types, how they are associated with MIC values, and how they are distributed through time in the different studies included in the collection. It is noteworthy that multiple PBP alleles are labelled as ‚Äúnew‚Äù in each of the genes PBP1a, PBP2b and PBP2x, and therefore that the effect of this allele composition has not been previously investigated."

One protein of particular interest is EloR, which has been found to have a correlation with pbp2b, a protein is known to play a role in increasing MICS.\nTo understand the impact of different variants of EloR on MIC, we created a BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) database for EloR and searched all of our isolates against it. Next we extracted the matches and the gene length of the match in the respective assemblies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Blast search of assemblies against the full eloR sequence. The figure shows the relationship between the gene length and alignment length of the protein Elor/eloR and the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the isolates in our database.

Panel B displays a scatter plot of the alignment length and MIC, with the points plotted in blue.\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in Figure¬†1, there is no apparent correlation between the gene length of Elor and the observed penicillin MIC. In fact, we see that most of the high MIC levels is observed around the normal gene length (approximately 986 base pairs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we searched directly for the EloR (annotated as EloR using Bakta) in the annotated assemblies and inspected the length of the amino acid sequence.

We set up a BLAST database for EloR, extracted matches and the gene length of the match in the respective assemblies, and searched for the protein ‚ÄúElor‚Äù in annotated assemblies to inspect the length of the amino acid sequence. Our results showed that there is no clear relationship between the gene length of Elor and the observed penicillin MIC, and most of the high MIC levels were observed around the normal gene length.

    "text": "Penicillin resistance is a major concern in the field of microbiology, as it poses a threat to the effectiveness of one of the most commonly used antibiotics. Pneumococci, a type of bacteria that can cause pneumonia, are particularly known for their ability to develop resistance to penicillin. In this website, we explore the the mechanisms of penicillin resistance in pneumococci and how it is related to compensatory adaptation.\nThis project focuses specifically on penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) and mutations that alter their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). PBPs are enzymes that are responsible for the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, and they are the primary target of penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. Mutations in the genes encoding these proteins can lead to changes in their structure and function, allowing the bacteria to become resistant to the antibiotics. By studying the genetic and molecular basis of these mutations, we can gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of penicillin resistance in pneumococci and develop more effective strategies monitoring development of resistance and for combating these infections.\n\nThe research presented on this website is a collaboration between the University of Oslo, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences."
