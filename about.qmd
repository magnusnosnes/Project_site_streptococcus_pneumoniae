Penicillin resistance is a major concern in the field of microbiology, as it poses a threat to the effectiveness of one of the most commonly used antibiotics. Pneumococci, a type of bacteria that can cause pneumonia, are particularly known for their ability to develop resistance to penicillin. In this website, we explore the the mechanisms of penicillin resistance in pneumococci and how it is related to compensatory adaptation.

This project focuses specifically on penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) and mutations that alter their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). PBPs are enzymes that are responsible for the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, and they are the primary target of penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. Mutations in the genes encoding these proteins can lead to changes in their structure and function, allowing the bacteria to become resistant to the antibiotics. By studying the genetic and molecular basis of these mutations, we can gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of penicillin resistance in pneumococci and develop more effective strategies monitoring development of resistance and for combating these infections.
